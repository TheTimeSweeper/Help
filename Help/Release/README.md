# Cooking Lag
Saw the wife playing and there was a second of stutter whenever a recipe was added to the cooking queue.  
This mod overrides some of the game's code with my attempts at more optimized code.

Reach out to `thetimesweeper` on discord or create an issue on github if you have any feedback or issues. If you do, please provide a log.

## Discalaimer: 
I don't play this game, so I haven't extensively playtested this to see if anything breaks. Everything seemed to be fine as the wife was playing.  
I suppose as a drastic measure you can back up your save in case it permanently deletes your ingredients or something, but I doubt anything like that will happen.

## MOAR OPTIMIZATION: 
*do people even say moar or am i just stuck in 2010*

Access the config and enable the RecipeCaching config. I saw little difference with this added, but could help if you're still looking to squeeze out that little extra juice.  
That is, if it's actually better. I'd appreciate some feedback if this made a difference.

This is off by default because it hard-codes by existing recipes and meals. if another mod adds a meal or recipe this may prevent those from working.
